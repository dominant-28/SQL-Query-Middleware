# Smart_Query_Proxy

**Smart_Query_Proxy** is a **full-stack developer tool** that acts as a **secure middleware proxy** between your application and your **MySQL** database.

It helps developers **analyze, monitor, and optimize SQL queries in real-time** during development — **without modifying production database logic**.

---

## How it Works

- **Connect Your Database:**  
  Provide your DB configuration. The app connects securely on your behalf.

- **Query Proxy:**  
  All SQL queries flow through **Smart_Query_Proxy** instead of directly hitting your database.

- **Analyze & Log:**  
  Every query is analyzed for execution time and sent to a **Flask microservice** (powered by **Gemini 2.5 Pro**) for real-time feedback and optimization tips.

- **Dashboard:**  
  - Run queries directly from the UI.
  - See instant results.
  - View logs and performance analytics.

- **API Key:**  
  Generate an API key and use it as a secure middle layer during development.
